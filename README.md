# Ex-PART

*Ex*plicit *P*lace *A*nd *R*oute *T*ool: a low-level hardware description language for FPGA's allowing fine-grained control over placement of modules.

NOTE: this software was written for academic research, therefore no time was spent on a user-friendly interface, clear errors, or any other feature one may expect from maturely developed software. Your best hope of working with this project is opening it in GHCi and looking around the code when errors are encountered. Furthermore, much information is dumped in the output directory of the synthesized project. Errors not given by this tool may have ended up in a .err or .log file.
